Interest in the constant volume of work, rather than sitting out all day watching logs and solving small problems.From the moment I was appointed to the post of system administrator, my level of knowledge was almost zero. Since I came across the narrow-profile AIX operating system and the same software for which it was not possible to prepare in advance. At the moment when I got settled, a complete modernization of the data centers was carried out. I had to constantly stay at work to understand what and how it works. I quickly got used to the pace and the sheer volume of work. All literature was also in English. Four months later, the commissioning of new equipment was carried out. Where I as an administrator participated alone
